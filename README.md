# Grad-CAM-Visualization-
Grad-CAM Visualization with VGG16 for Image Classification
This project implements Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visually interpret the decisions made by the pre-trained VGG16 model on ImageNet data. By using Grad-CAM, we can generate heatmaps to highlight important regions in an image that contribute to a specific class prediction. This is helpful for understanding and explaining deep learning models, especially in image classification tasks.

**Key Features:**
Pre-trained VGG16 Model: Utilizes the VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, to classify input images.
Grad-CAM Implementation: Computes Grad-CAM heatmaps for visualizing the regions of the image most relevant to the classification decision.
OpenCV Integration: Uses OpenCV for image processing and displaying the heatmaps on the original image.
Matplotlib Visualization: Displays the original image alongside the heatmap overlay using matplotlib.
Functionality:
Image Classification: Given an input image, the VGG16 model classifies it into one of the 1,000 ImageNet categories.
Heatmap Generation: Grad-CAM heatmaps highlight the areas of the image that most influenced the classification.
Overlay Heatmaps: The generated heatmap is overlayed on the original image for better visual understanding of the model's focus.
Interactive Visualization: The project offers side-by-side visualization of the original image and the heatmap-augmented image.
